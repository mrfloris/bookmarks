# Bookmarks

A curated list of bookmarks, or something.

---

## Introduction

Since the inception of Mozilla, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and others, I've consistently overlooked bookmark management. Neither have I attempted to organize my bookmarks nor taken the effort to synchronize them unless it happened automatically. It's been a quarter of a century; I believe it's about time I attempt to create a repository for a top bookmarks bar in my browsers, along with an additional backup of items I come across and wish to remember, rediscover, or use on an annual basis or so.

## Contributions

With the assistance of the great Internet people, I aspire to enhance my organizational skills, refine my list, and acquire useful tricks and tips that can be shared here too.

- Please don't hesitate to clone and submit pull requests to this repository for making suggestions. If you come across any broken links, you can also open an issue ticket to report them.

- Contributors are welcome to add their names here and include links to their Discord profiles, websites, or any other relevant platforms.

## The Top Bookmarks Bar

When I launch a browser, I personally prefer to have a concise list of bookmarks that I can open in new tabs with a simple shift-click. I like to keep this list as short as possible, positioned just beneath the location input field (where you enter web addresses). This way, when I intend to visit streaming sites, I can easily shift-click the ones I'm interested in. Similarly, if I plan to engage with social media, I can swiftly click on those bookmarks.

For services like the `Disney Plus Streaming Service`, I don't jot down the full name; instead, I rely on recognizing the brand through its icon and rename it as something shorter (like `d+`). As a result, I have around twenty bookmarks arranged on my monitor.

## Hierarchy

The remaining bookmarks consist of convenient links that I regularly visit and have marked as favorites, so to speak. This implies that if I were to type `cha..`, it would promptly suggest `chat.openai.com`. I'll most likely have a folder or label named 'handy stuff' containing that particular link.

However, if I'm being candid, I'll likely end up with over 100 bookmarks scattered across different folders or within the main one. I also intend to (seek assistance and) contemplate the optimal approach to tackle this situation. This way, I can establish a system that's more coherent, organized, and user-friendly for my future usage.

## Tools

At this point I have no tools on how to export/import this, to help YOU. I am open to suggestions; preferably something that works on macOS / Chrome, because that's my daily driver. 

## Call for Action

If you see the type of bookmarks I have, and you have some great handy tools, or a more complete list of streaming services, or anything you feel like sharing; contribute! I welcome to learn. 

- Note please: Let's keep it family-friendly. I have no interest in anything illegal, dodgy, sus, nsfw, or stuff along those lines.
